Handheld XRF for Shipwrecks
Dr. Raymond Hayes, Underwater Archaeologist, made a major discovery in his investigation of shipwrecks. He found a quick, non-destructive method to analyze them - Handheld XRF. He can now study specimens where he finds them, even when they are moving on platforms off shore, like on boat decks. He no longer has to remove a piece from the wreck and send it off to a lab for analysis. He can simply analyze artifacts on-the-spot without harming...

Guidelines for Automated Ultrasonic Inspection Austenitic Welds
Michael Moles and Sebastien Rigault
Evident
Austenitic welds present major inspection problems due to their large grain structure. Radiography does not work well, so ultrasonics is the main choice for inspecting austenitic welds, LNG tank welds, cladding and centrifugally-cast stainless steel pipe. For ultrasonics, the large austenitic grains cause beam skewing, splitting and attenuation. This paper will...

Friction Stir Weld Inspection
Contact Us
Overview
Friction-stir welding (FSW) is a process mostly used on aluminum parts for high grade applications, notably in the Aerospace and Defense industry. Instead of using added material as is done for conventional welding methods, a tack tool is used to heat and mix the two pieces of metal in the jointed area.
FSW has multiple advantages over traditional welding methods; FSW avoids the defect types that tend to arise with liquid phase cooling in other w...

Eddy Current Array Tutorial
Eddy current array and conventional eddy current technology share the same basic principle. Alternating current injected into a coil creates a magnetic field (in blue). When the coil is placed over a conductive part, opposed alternating currents (eddy currents, in red) are generated. Defects in the part disturb the path of the eddy currents (in yellow). This disturbance can be measured by the coil.

Depth of Penetration
Eddy Current Array Tutorial
Eddy current density does not remain constant across the depth of a material. The density is greatest at the surface and decreases exponentially with depth (the "skin effect"). The
standard depth of penetration
equation (shown to the right) is used to explain the penetration capability of eddy current testing, which decreases with increasing frequency, conductivity, or permeability. For a material that is both thick and uniform, the standard depth...

Multiplexing
Eddy Current Array Tutorial
Multiplexing is the process by which multiple analog message signals are combined into one digital signal on a shared medium. When eddy current array data is multiplexed, the individual eddy current coils are excited at different times, allowing the system to excite all of the coils in the probe without ever exciting any two adjacent coils at the same time. An undesirable effect known as mutual inductance (magnetic coupling between coils in close proximit...

The main purpose of performing normalization is to standardize sensitivity for an ECA probe. To do this, the operator scans a sample containing a calibration defect in order to generate the same eddy current signal for each channel. For most applications, a defect such as a long transversal notch will suffice (see illustration to the right). Using the calibration defect, the operator adjusts the gain and rotation of each channel so that the same phase an...

2.2 Generating Ultrasound (Transducers)
Ultrasonic Flaw Detection Tutorial
The ultrasonic waves used for flaw detection are generated and received by small probes called ultrasonic transducers, which convert electrical pulses into sound waves and sound waves into electrical energy. Transducers for flaw detection come in a wide variety of sizes, frequencies, and case styles, but most have a common internal structure.
Typically, the active element of the transducer is a thin disk, square, or recta...

Advanced Phased Array Inspection for Early Detection of HTHA
Evident Industrial Resources
Abstract
High-temperature hydrogen attack (HTHA) is one of the most critical failures that assets in the oil and gas or chemical industries may experience, and can lead to environmental contamination, explosions, injury, or even loss of life. For this reason, industries are constantly looking for better methods to detect HTHA at its early stage, when corrective action can still be initiated.
